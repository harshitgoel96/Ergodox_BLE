## What has been happening in the project ?

* **8-Jan-2019**  
    Realised ergodox was the best keyboard I have. Need to make one more for home.  

* **9-Jan-2019**  
    Got to know about bluemicro, a ble capable for promicro. Decided that I will make the new ergodox bluetooth.  

* **10-Jan-2019**  
    After chatting with jpconstantineau, realise that existing ergodone or ergodox are not going to work with BlueMicro due to placement issues. Decided to mod only the ergodone case to fit bluemicro on one side.  

* **14-Jan 2019**  
    Further dicusions with jpconstantineau made me realised that i2c at the moment is not supported by bluemicro, and will take time. At the same time got to know about Proton-C. Decided to modify the existing Ergodox PCB.  

* **16-Jan-2019**  
    Modifing existing pcb was tough due to my limited knowledge about kicad.  

* **19-Jan 2019**  
    Role up the sleeve and decided to remake a new pcb.  

* **20-Jan-2019**  
    Added clearance for Proton-C, make sure the edge cuts are within existing Ergodone case.  

* **21-Jan-2019**  
    Realised it was simple enough to change the footprints on the schema and make it work with the kicad libs and footprints that I had.  

* **22-Jan-2019**  
    USB-C is the future, added it to the PCB. Always look to the future.  

* **23-Jan-2019**  
    Generate Gerbers, and schema pdf  to get feedback from a few of people.  

* **24-Jan-2019**  
    Feedback was positive. Gave order to JLCPCB. Fingers crossed.
