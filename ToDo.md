ToDo List
=========

This list is just for reference, there is no priority/ETA set for any of these fixes

* USB C footprint used here is not good enough for hand solder, will need to replace with a more expensive one.
* There is no way to access the ON/OFF or replace battery on the case. No idea how I can fix this. Also will need some pins to wire up some pins from bluemicro for easy flashing and support for on/off switch on both CR2032 and Li/Po version. Needs brainstorming.
