# There is no active development on this keyboard. Feel free to do whatever you want. I have moved to Pteron36.
The PCB is in working statue, but no further support or development will be done on this project.

Ergodox BLE
===========

I love my [Ergodox](https://i.imgur.com/aIGm8G6h.jpg) , but it is not Bluetooth. I recently got to know about Bluemicro from u/jpconstantineau which is replacement for pro micro with BLE built in, and I also got to know about Proton C, which has USB C connector and is built for QMK. The original Ergodox uses Tinsy and Ergodone uses pro micro. Both the PCBs don't have support for either of the MCU directly and so I got to work and redid the PCB and I came up with this.

This is my first attempt at making a PCB and I need help from PCB hardware experts if everything is ok or do I need make some changes.

The Ergodox Keyboard was originally developed by “Dox” (Dominic Beauchamp).
